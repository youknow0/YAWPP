YAWPP
========

YAWPP is Yet Another Wordpress Podcasting Plugin. While having a super-
simple and minimalistic aproach, it is still able to cover most 
requirements of the average podcaster.

YAWPP might require heavy tweaking to fit your requirements, as it was
developed in a quick and dirty way.

Localization 
------
The configuration backend is currently in German. 

YAWPP_Podcasts class
------
You may use this class to get podcast episodes that are managed by 
YAWPP. This could i.e. be handy for developing a widget that displays
the latest podcast episodes.
